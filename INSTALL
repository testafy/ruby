The Testafy module is compatible with Ruby versions 1.8.7 and later.

Testafy requires that you have rubygems installed.
It requires 2 gems, in addition:
    rest-client (install with 'gem install rest-client')
    json (install with 'gem install json')

Once you have them installed, just "require 'testafy'" and start running tests!

Note for Ruby 1.9.2+, if Testafy is in the working directory, try "require_relative 'testafy'" instead.
