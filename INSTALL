Testafy requires that you have rubygems installd.
It requires 2 gems, in addition:
    rest-client
    json

They are both installable via 'gem install gemname'.
Once you have them installed, simply "require 'testafy'" and run tests to your heart's content!
(Testafy should be in the same directory as files requiring it.)
